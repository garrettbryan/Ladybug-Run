Note to the evaluator:
I really pushed myself on this one. I kept thinking of new features and adding them before I had a strong grasp of how to organize the code. I finally had a good dialog here:

and got some good insight from studying vincenzo's code. I basically had to start over and introduce new features one at a time. I realized that I was adding way tooo much when I got into design patterns. I know there is a future project that deals with design patterns and I figure that I will revisit the video game after I gain more experience. Overall a great experience.
